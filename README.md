# OOP(Object Oriented Programming)

## General Idea

```python
	#!/usr/bin/python3

	import pycodestyle as pcs

	a = "Hello, World!"
	print("{}".format(a))

	checker = pcs.Checker('hello.py', show_source=True)
	errors = checker.check_all()

	print("Found {} errors".format(errors))
```

## Definition of Terms

_OOP_

> Object-Oriented Programming, as name suggests, is a different approach to programming that brings together data and functions that execute on them. It basically supports encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. It also includes data hiding feature therefore it is more secure. This model is based on real life entities that focuses on by whom task is to be done rather than focusing on what to do.([GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-structured-programming-and-object-oriented-programming/))

## A little history

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)))

So glad that I'm learning Python and other new higher level programming languages! OMG :grinning: :sunglasses: :tada:
